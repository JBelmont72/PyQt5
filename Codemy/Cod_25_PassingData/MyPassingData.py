Key Fixes:
Incorrect Inheritance and Setup:
‚ùå You were inheriting from the Ui_MainWindow class and trying to use setupUi() on the same object. That‚Äôs redundant and problematic.
‚úÖ Now the MainWindow class inherits only from QMainWindow and uses Ui_MainWindow via composition (self.ui = MainWindowUI()), which is the clean and expected way when using pyuic5-generated UI.
Button Setup Outside UI Class:
‚ùå You were recreating buttons (QPushButton('Submit', self)) manually after using a .ui file ‚Äî this overwrites or bypasses the .ui design.
‚úÖ Now, you reference the UI components created in Qt Designer (e.g., self.ui.Submit) and connect signals properly.
Second Window Class Defined After Use:
‚ùå You defined Ui_SecondWindow after referencing it, which can confuse logic and dependency flow.
‚úÖ The second window is now cleanly structured and passed a reference to the main window for communication.
No Mechanism to Share Data:
‚ùå You had no method to send or receive data between windows.
‚úÖ The second window now calls main_window.update_label() to send data back.

üîÅ Where is main_window coming from?
Look at this part of your MainWindow class:

self.second_window = SecondWindow(self)  # Pass reference to main window
‚úÖ What‚Äôs happening here?

You're creating an instance of SecondWindow inside the MainWindow class.
The self in SecondWindow(self) refers to the current instance of MainWindow.
That means you're explicitly passing a reference to the current main window into the second window.
üß† Why do we do this?
So the SecondWindow can call methods or access widgets from the MainWindow.

This line in SecondWindow saves that reference:

self.main_window = main_window
Now, inside SecondWindow, you can use:

self.main_window.update_label(text)
...to call a method in the main window ‚Äî in this case, updating the text in the lineEdit.

üß© Visual Summary
[MainWindow]
    ‚îú‚îÄ sets up its own UI (Connect1)
    ‚îú‚îÄ has a QPushButton called "Open"
    ‚îú‚îÄ creates ‚Üí [SecondWindow(self)]
                      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ receives and stores reference to MainWindow as self.main_window
                             ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ can now call self.main_window.update_label(...)
This is a form of bidirectional communication, where each window can interact with the other
