i used py2app

TO convert the ToDo_debase.py into a desktop app!!!
 STEP 1: Save Your Python Script
Save your script file somewhere convenient. For this example: ( can just have this in VSCode)

~/Documents/PythonApps/todo_list_app.py
(You can name the script anything you like, just keep track of the filename.)
üîπ STEP 2: Test the App Runs from Terminal
Open Terminal, and test your script:

python3 ~/Documents/PythonApps/todo_list_app.py
If it works‚Äîgreat! You're ready to wrap it.
üîπ STEP 3: Install py2app
You'll use py2app to convert your script into a macOS .app bundle.
In Terminal:

pip3 install py2app
üîπ STEP 4: Create a Setup File for py2app
In the same folder as your Python script (todo_list_app.py), create a new file called setup.py:

cd ~/Documents/PythonApps
touch setup.py
Paste the following into setup.py:

from setuptools import setup
APP = ['todo_list_app.py']
DATA_FILES = []
OPTIONS = {
    'argv_emulation': True,
    'iconfile': 'Icons_ios/7.icns',  # You'll convert PNG to ICNS below
    'includes': ['PyQt5', 'sqlite3'],
    'packages': ['PyQt5'],
}

setup(
    app=APP,
    data_files=DATA_FILES,
    options={'py2app': OPTIONS},
    setup_requires=['py2app'],
)

üîπ STEP 5: Convert PNG Icon to ICNS (macOS icon format)
macOS needs the icon to be in .icns format. Here's how:
Open the Preview app and open 7.png from ~/Documents/Icons_ios/7.png.
Use File > Export, and choose:
Format: ICNS
Save as: 7.icns
Save to: ~/Documents/PythonApps/Icons_ios
If "ICNS" isn't available:
Save as PNG at 1024x1024,
Use Terminal to convert with iconutil:
bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir ~/Documents/PythonApps/Icons_ios/7.iconset
sips -z 16 16     7.png --out Icons_ios/7.iconset/icon_16x16.png
sips -z 32 32     7.png --out Icons_ios/7.iconset/icon_16x16@2x.png
sips -z 128 128   7.png --out Icons_ios/7.iconset/icon_128x128.png
sips -z 256 256   7.png --out Icons_ios/7.iconset/icon_128x128@2x.png
iconutil -c icns ~/Documents/PythonApps/Icons_ios/7.iconset -o ~/Documents/PythonApps/Icons_ios/7.icns
üîπ STEP 6: Build the .app
Back in Terminal, from your PythonApps directory:
bash
Copy
Edit
python3 setup.py py2app
After a moment, you‚Äôll see a folder called dist/ with your .app inside:

~/Documents/PythonApps/dist/todo_list_app.app
üîπ STEP 7: Move to Desktop and Test
Drag todo_list_app.app to your Desktop.
Double-click to test.
‚úÖ It should open your GUI with the database.
üîπ STEP 8: Optional ‚Äì Add to Dock or Launchpad
Dock: Drag the app to the Dock to pin it.
Launchpad: Move it to /Applications:

mv ~/Documents/PythonApps/dist/todo_list_app.app /Applications/
Would you like help bundling the SQLite database or ensuring it creates the database in the app's resource folder?

Yes. I want to be able to use the def grab_it() method to restore the previously saved data to the application when I  select the icon.
###~~~~ this is a deiversion due to a miscommunication that I am saving to look at later:
since you're using a PyQt5 application and want to restore previously saved gesture data when clicking an icon (like a toolbar or button icon), you can achieve this by connecting the icon's triggered/clicked signal to your grab_it() function.
Here‚Äôs how you can wire it up in a clean, modular way:
‚úÖ Step-by-Step Plan
1. Ensure grab_it() is defined in your main class
It should handle reading your saved data (e.g., from a .npz file or .json) and populating any relevant widgets or internal state.
2. Create a QAction or QPushButton with an icon
You can do this either programmatically or from your .ui file (Qt Designer). Here's a simple example with a QToolBar and QAction.
3. Connect that action to grab_it()
üîß Sample Code Snippet
Suppose you have a MainWindow class with a toolbar icon to restore data:
python
Copy
Edit
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QMainWindow, QAction, QToolBar, QFileDialog, QMessageBox
from PyQt5.QtGui import QIcon
import json  # or numpy if using .npz
import os

class MainWindow(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.init_ui()
        self.gesture_data = {}  # Will store the loaded gestures

    def init_ui(self):
        toolbar = QToolBar("Main Toolbar")
        self.addToolBar(toolbar)

        # Create restore icon action
        restore_action = QAction(QIcon("icons/restore.png"), "Restore Gestures", self)
        restore_action.setStatusTip("Restore previously saved gestures")
        restore_action.triggered.connect(self.grab_it)

        toolbar.addAction(restore_action)

    def grab_it(self):
        try:
            file_name, _ = QFileDialog.getOpenFileName(self, "Open Saved Gestures", "", "JSON Files (*.json);;All Files (*)")
            if file_name:
                with open(file_name, 'r') as f:
                    self.gesture_data = json.load(f)
                QMessageBox.information(self, "Success", "Gestures restored successfully.")
                # Update the GUI or internal state accordingly
        except Exception as e:
            QMessageBox.critical(self, "Error", f"Failed to load data:\n{e}")
If you're using .npz from NumPy instead of JSON, replace the json.load() section with:

import numpy as np
data = np.load(file_name, allow_pickle=True)
self.gesture_data = dict(data)

########~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
back on track:
Your current Ui_myListWindow class is well-organized, and I see that you've also included thoughtful inline comments and tried different strategies for handling delete_it(). You're right about the issue with:
python
Copy
Edit
if selected_items:
When selected_items is 0 (i.e. the first item in the list is selected), if 0: evaluates to False in Python. So that block gets skipped, even though 0 is a valid index. You can solve this with a clearer condition:
‚úÖ Fix:
python
Copy
Edit
selected_index = self.myList.currentRow()
if selected_index != -1:  # -1 means no selection
    self.myList.takeItem(selected_index)
This way, it correctly allows deletion of item 0.

Preserve the list using sqlite3 ‚Äî done ‚úîÔ∏è
Call it using a custom desktop icon (7.png) ‚Äî partly done
Restore saved list items from the DB on launch ‚Äî working via grab_all() ‚úîÔ∏è
Save new items to the DB ‚Äî currently missing
Delete items from both UI and DB ‚Äî currently missing
Package it into a Mac app with the icon ‚Äî not yet covered
‚úÖ Here's what you need to complete it:
üîß 1. Modify add_it() to insert into SQLite:
python
Copy
Edit
def add_it(self):
    item_text = self.myItems.text()
    if item_text:
        self.myList.addItem(QtWidgets.QListWidgetItem(item_text))
        self.myItems.clear()
        # Save to database
        conn = sqlite3.connect('todo_list.db')
        c = conn.cursor()
        c.execute("INSERT INTO todo_list (list_item) VALUES (?)", (item_text,))
        conn.commit()
        conn.close()
üîß 2. Modify delete_it() to remove from both UI and DB:
python
Copy
Edit
def delete_it(self):
    selected_items = self.myList.selectedItems()
    if selected_items:
        for item in selected_items:
            item_text = item.text()
            # Remove from UI
            self.myList.takeItem(self.myList.row(item))
            # Remove from DB
            conn = sqlite3.connect('todo_list.db')
            c = conn.cursor()
            c.execute("DELETE FROM todo_list WHERE list_item = ?", (item_text,))
            conn.commit()
            conn.close()
üîß 3. Modify clear_it() to clear both UI and DB:
python
Copy
Edit
def clear_it(self):
    self.myList.clear()
    conn = sqlite3.connect('todo_list.db')
    c = conn.cursor()
    c.execute("DELETE FROM todo_list")
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
üñ•Ô∏è 4. Package as a Mac app with icon 7.png:
Use py2app or pyinstaller. Here‚Äôs how to do it with pyinstaller (recommended):
Step-by-step:
Install PyInstaller (if not yet):
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pyinstaller
Place 7.png in the same folder.
Create a ToDo.spec or run:
bash
Copy
Edit
pyinstaller --windowed --onefile --icon=7.png ToDo.py
‚ö†Ô∏è --windowed avoids the terminal window. Use --noconfirm for repeated runs.
Your .app file will appear under dist/ToDo.app

To make your ToDo.py PyQt5 application easily accessible from your Mac desktop with a custom icon (7.png), and to ensure it preserves and restores your to-do list using SQLite, you can follow these steps:‚Äã
‚úÖ Step 1: Package Your PyQt5 App into a macOS Application
Use PyInstaller to bundle your Python script into a standalone .app application:‚Äã
Stack Overflow

Python GUIs
+6
Install PyInstaller:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pyinstaller
Navigate to Your Script's Directory:
bash
Copy
Edit
cd /path/to/your/script
Run PyInstaller:
bash
Copy
Edit
pyinstaller --windowed --icon=7.icns ToDo.py
Ensure your 7.png is converted to 7.icns format, as macOS requires .icns files for application icons.‚Äã
This will create a dist/ToDo.app bundle.‚Äã
For more detailed guidance, refer to this tutorial on packaging PyQt5 applications into a macOS app with PyInstaller.
üé® Step 2: Convert 7.png to .icns Format
macOS applications require icons in the .icns format. Here's how to convert your 7.png to 7.icns:‚Äã
Create Iconset Folder:
bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir 7.iconset
Generate Icons of Various Sizes:
bash
Copy
Edit
sips -z 16 16     7.png --out 7.iconset/icon_16x16.png
sips -z 32 32     7.png --out 7.iconset/icon_16x16@2x.png
sips -z 32 32     7.png --out 7.iconset/icon_32x32.png
sips -z 64 64     7.png --out 7.iconset/icon_32x32@2x.png
sips -z 128 128   7.png --out 7.iconset/icon_128x128.png
sips -z 256 256   7.png --out 7.iconset/icon_128x128@2x.png
sips -z 256 256   7.png --out 7.iconset/icon_256x256.png
sips -z 512 512   7.png --out 7.iconset/icon_256x256@2x.png
sips -z 512 512   7.png --out 7.iconset/icon_512x512.png
sips -z 1024 1024 7.png --out 7.iconset/icon_512x512@2x.png
Convert to .icns:
bash
Copy
Edit
iconutil -c icns 7.iconset
This will generate 7.icns in your current directory.‚Äã
üìå Step 3: Create a Desktop Shortcut
Once you have your ToDo.app ready, you can create a desktop shortcut:‚Äã
Locate the Application: Navigate to the dist folder where ToDo.app is located.
Create Alias: Right-click on ToDo.app and select Make Alias.
Move Alias to Desktop: Drag the newly created alias to your desktop.
You can rename the alias as desired.‚Äã
üóÉÔ∏è Step 4: Ensure SQLite Data Persistence
Your current implementation uses SQLite to store to-do items. To ensure data persists between sessions:‚Äã
Database Location:
Ensure that todo_list.db is stored in a consistent location, such as within the application's resources or a designated user directory.‚Äã
Modify Database Path in Code:
Update your code to reference the correct path to todo_list.db. For example:‚Äã
python
Copy
Edit
import os
db_path = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser("~"), "Documents", "ToDoApp", "todo_list.db")
conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
Create Directory if Not Exists:
Ensure the directory exists before attempting to connect:‚Äã
python
Copy
Edit
os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(db_path), exist_ok=True)
By following these steps, your application will maintain its to-do list data across sessions.‚Äã

)
Thanks for sharing that ‚Äî it looks like you may have accidentally run PyInstaller on your PNG image file (rubberDuckey.png) instead of converting it into an .icns icon file.
The file you posted (rubberDuckey.spec) is a PyInstaller spec file, generated when you run something like:
bash
Copy
Edit
pyinstaller rubberDuckey.png
This would not generate an .icns file ‚Äî it‚Äôs attempting to treat the PNG as a Python script, which is incorrect.
‚úÖ Here's how to properly convert rubberDuckey.png to a macOS-compatible .icns file:
Step 1: Create an .iconset folder
bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir rubberDuckey.iconset
Step 2: Generate icon sizes from your PNG
Make sure rubberDuckey.png is square (e.g., 1024√ó1024). Then run:
bash
Copy
Edit
sips -z 16 16     rubberDuckey.png --out rubberDuckey.iconset/icon_16x16.png
sips -z 32 32     rubberDuckey.png --out rubberDuckey.iconset/icon_16x16@2x.png
sips -z 32 32     rubberDuckey.png --out rubberDuckey.iconset/icon_32x32.png
sips -z 64 64     rubberDuckey.png --out rubberDuckey.iconset/icon_32x32@2x.png
sips -z 128 128   rubberDuckey.png --out rubberDuckey.iconset/icon_128x128.png
sips -z 256 256   rubberDuckey.png --out rubberDuckey.iconset/icon_128x128@2x.png
sips -z 256 256   rubberDuckey.png --out rubberDuckey.iconset/icon_256x256.png
sips -z 512 512   rubberDuckey.png --out rubberDuckey.iconset/icon_256x256@2x.png
sips -z 512 512   rubberDuckey.png --out rubberDuckey.iconset/icon_512x512.png
sips -z 1024 1024 rubberDuckey.png --out rubberDuckey.iconset/icon_512x512@2x.png
Step 3: Convert to .icns
Now convert the rubberDuckey.iconset folder to .icns:
bash
Copy
Edit
iconutil -c icns rubberDuckey.iconset
This creates rubberDuckey.icns in the current directory.
üîÅ What to do next
Use the resulting rubberDuckey.icns file when building your PyInstaller app:
bash
Copy
Edit
pyinstaller --windowed --icon=rubberDuckey.icns ToDo.py
Would you like me to generate a complete setup.py for py2app using this icon as well?
Here's a minimal working setup.py for building your PyQt5 (or any GUI-based) Mac app using py2app, and including your custom rubberDuckey.icns icon.
‚úÖ setup.py (for py2app)
python
Copy
Edit
from setuptools import setup

APP = ['ToDo.py']  # Your main script
DATA_FILES = []    # Include any data files or assets here
OPTIONS = {
    'argv_emulation': True,
    'iconfile': 'rubberDuckey.icns',
    'packages': ['PyQt5'],  # Add other needed packages here
}

setup(
    app=APP,
    data_files=DATA_FILES,
    options={'py2app': OPTIONS},
    setup_requires=['py2app'],
)
üì¶ Steps to build the app
Make sure you have py2app installed:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install py2app
Run the following command in the same directory as setup.py:
bash
Copy
Edit
python setup.py py2app
After it builds, your app will appear in the dist folder as ToDo.app with your rubberDuckey.icns as its icon.
üìù Notes
Ensure rubberDuckey.icns is in the same directory as setup.py.
If your app needs additional assets (images, UI files, etc.), you can add them to DATA_FILES.
Would you like help including external resources or packaging additional data (e.g., .ui files or config 
Is it necessary to run pyinstaller --windowed --icon=rubberDuckey.icns ToDo.py prior to the setup.py?
No, it is not necessary‚Äîand actually not recommended‚Äîto run pyinstaller at all if you're using py2app.
Here's why:
pyinstaller and py2app are completely separate packaging tools.
pyinstaller is cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux), while py2app is designed specifically for macOS.
Do not mix them‚Äîyou only need to run one, and since you're creating a .app for macOS, use py2app only.
‚úÖ What you should do:
Just follow these steps:
Ensure rubberDuckey.icns and setup.py are in the same directory.
Run:
bash
Copy
Edit
python setup.py py2app

After that, you'll get a dist/ToDo.app with the duck icon already applied‚Äîno need for pyinstaller at all.
Would you like help testing the resulting .app or making it portable for distribution (e.g., zip it or notarize it)?
I have the dist/ToDo_icon.app in my Codemy folder in my repo.  How do I activate it on my local computer?

To run your ToDo_icon.app locally on your Mac from your Cody folder, follow one of these methods:
‚úÖ Method 1: Double-click from Finder
Open Finder.
Navigate to your repo's Cody/dist folder.
Double-click ToDo_icon.app.
If it doesn‚Äôt open right away (due to macOS security), see below.
‚úÖ Method 2: Open from Terminal
Open Terminal and run:
bash
Copy
Edit
open ~/path/to/Cody/dist/ToDo_icon.app
Replace ~/path/to/ with the full path to your Cody folder. If it‚Äôs in your home directory, just use:
bash
Copy
Edit
open ~/Cody/dist/ToDo_icon.app
üõ°Ô∏è If macOS blocks the app (security warning)
You might see:
‚ÄúToDo_icon.app‚Äù can‚Äôt be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.
To fix that:
Open System Settings > Privacy & Security.
Scroll down to ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù section.
You should see an option to ‚ÄúAllow Anyway‚Äù for ToDo_icon.app.
Then re-open the app (use Finder or Terminal again).
Would you like help bundling it for distribution or digitally signing it so it won‚Äôt trigger Gatekeeper next time?
I used the path to get to : judsonbelmont@MacBook-Pro ToDo_icon.app %    this is my pwd. judsonbelmont@MacBook-Pro ToDo_icon.app % pwd
/Users/judsonbelmont/Documents/SharedFolders/Pico/PyQt5/Codemy/dist/ToDo_icon.app
judsonbelmont@MacBook-Pro ToDo_icon.app %  How do I open it from here?

You're already inside the .app bundle folder ‚Äî that's why you're in ToDo_icon.app % as your prompt. This is the internal structure of the app, not where you run it from.
To launch the app properly, go one level up, then run open:
‚úÖ Steps:
Exit the .app bundle:
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ..
Then open the app with:
bash
Copy
Edit
open ToDo_icon.app
That should launch it as a proper macOS app. If you want to make a Dock shortcut later, I can guide you through that too.
Want to create a Desktop alias or Dock icon?
I used open ToDo_icon.app and the PyQt5 window opens and the cursor blinks on the mainWInodw but there is no functionality at this point. Is that correct at this point?
Yes, that‚Äôs expected behavior if your ToDo.py file (or your PyQt5 app) currently only defines the GUI layout but doesn‚Äôt have any interactive logic or functionality wired up yet.
If:
The PyQt5 window opens,
You see the main window and a blinking cursor in a text box or input field,
But clicking buttons or typing doesn't do anything meaningful,
Then your GUI is likely loading correctly, but it doesn't yet have signals, slots, or functionality connected to handle user actions.
üîç To Check
Open ToDo.py and look for whether you're:
Connecting any buttons (QPushButton) to slots or methods (e.g., button.clicked.connect(...))
Handling text inputs, task storage, display updates, etc.
If not, that's your next step ‚Äî building out the actual features of your ToDo app.
Would you like help adding basic functionality like:
Adding a task when you press Enter or click a button,
Deleting selected tasks,
Saving tasks to a file?
Let me know where you're at with the code, and I can guide you further.

If things go wrong or how they can go wrong: 
What‚Äôs Working and Clear:
This is your To-Do List PyQt5 app, which:
Uses sqlite3 to store tasks.
Has a GUI built from code (possibly converted from a .ui file using pyuic5).
Contains button handlers (add_it, delete_it, clear_it, grab_all) that interact with the list and database.
The app correctly creates a todo_list table if it doesn‚Äôt exist.
You‚Äôre embedding database logic directly into UI event handlers ‚Äî fine for small projects.
Your compiled app in dist/To_Do_icon.app seems to still be running this original code.
‚ùì Your Main Concern:
You said:
"It appears to be exactly the same as I started with and contains the same functions."
This raises the question:
Did you expect the version in dist/To_Do_icon.app to be different?
If yes, here are a few possible explanations:
üîç Common Reasons the App Seems "Unchanged" After Rebuilding
PyInstaller is packaging an outdated version:
If your source .py file was not saved before running pyinstaller, it will bundle the last saved version.
‚úÖ Fix: Always Save All in your editor before running:
bash
Copy
Edit
pyinstaller --windowed --icon=To_Do_icon.icns To_Do_list.py
Wrong file packaged:
Double-check you're packaging the right file. For example, make sure To_Do_list.py is the file you're editing.
Cached build artifacts:
dist/ and build/ folders can retain old copies.
‚úÖ Fix:
bash
Copy
Edit
rm -rf build dist __pycache__
pyinstaller --windowed --icon=To_Do_icon.icns To_Do_list.py
The app is working correctly ‚Äî you just haven‚Äôt changed anything yet:
If you haven‚Äôt made visible changes to the UI or behavior (e.g., changing button labels, modifying logic), it may look the same.
üß™ Tip to Confirm Build Differences
Add a quick visible change in your code before rebuilding:
python
Copy
Edit
self.Add_Item.setText("Add Something!")  # Temporary label change
Then rebuild and launch the app again. If the button still says "Add Item", it‚Äôs not using your updated file.
‚úÖ Minor Code Suggestions
You defined delete_it() twice ‚Äî only the last one is used. Delete the duplicate to avoid confusion.
You have a commented-out alternate table schema with id and item ‚Äî decide whether you want a unique ID for items. It‚Äôs useful if you ever want to prevent duplicates or update items later.
Would you like a checklist to ensure you‚Äôre always building the latest version of your PyQt app correctly?

To help you get your program to function like it did before it became an app, here‚Äôs a clear process you can follow to troubleshoot and restore its original behavior. You likely used Automator, MSTY, or some other packaging tool to convert a Python script into a macOS app, and now it's behaving differently ‚Äî perhaps due to issues like:
Missing Python virtual environment
Missing dependencies (e.g., OpenCV, PyQt5)
GUI not showing up
Script not running at all
Here‚Äôs what you should do:
‚úÖ Step 1: Test the Script Outside the App
Run the original Python file directly in Terminal or VS Code:
bash
Copy
Edit
python3 /path/to/your_script.py
If it works as expected, the issue is likely with the app bundle.
‚úÖ Step 2: Check the App's .app Bundle
If you used Automator or py2app, the app may not be using the correct Python or virtual environment.
Right-click on the .app ‚Üí Show Package Contents
Go to Contents/MacOS/ ‚Äî this should contain your script or wrapper.
Open Terminal and run the binary directly to see error output:
bash
Copy
Edit
/path/to/YourApp.app/Contents/MacOS/YourApp
This usually shows missing module errors or Python not found issues.
‚úÖ Step 3: Check Your Python Environment
Was your app created using:
A virtual environment?
System Python or Homebrew Python?
The app may be failing if:
It can't find your packages (like PyQt5, mediapipe, etc.)
It was hardcoded to a virtualenv path that no longer exists
If your original script used a virtual environment, you can repackage the app ensuring it activates the environment correctly.
‚úÖ Step 4: Use a Terminal Wrapper Script
If you used Automator, make sure it runs a shell script like:
bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash
source /path/to/venv/bin/activate
python3 /path/to/your_script.py
Then set that script as the Automator action.
‚úÖ Step 5: Rebuild the App Cleanly (Optional but Cleanest)
If nothing works, rebuild the .app using one of these:
üîπ Option 1: Automator App Wrapper
Open Automator ‚Üí select "Application"
Add "Run Shell Script"
Paste:
bash
Copy
Edit
source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate
python3 /full/path/to/your_script.py
Save as .app ‚Äî works for most GUI programs.
üîπ Option 2: py2app (for PyQt5 or GUI apps)
Install py2app:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install py2app
Add a setup.py:
python
Copy
Edit
from setuptools import setup

APP = ['your_script.py']
OPTIONS = {
    'argv_emulation': True,
    'packages': ['PyQt5', 'cv2', 'mediapipe'],  # Add all used packages
}
setup(
    app=APP,
    options={'py2app': OPTIONS},
    setup_requires=['py2app'],
)
Then run:
bash
Copy
Edit
python setup.py py2app
If You Tell Me:
How you built the app (Automator? MSTY? py2app?)
What your original script does
What happens when you run the app now
‚Ä¶I can give you a much more direct fix.
Would you like to walk through rebuilding the app or debug the existing one together?
my virtual environment is called PyQt5 and I have the app and the original program all in the subfolder named Comedy.  can this be the problem?

Yes ‚Äî this could definitely be the problem. Here's why:
üîç What's Likely Happening:
If your virtual environment PyQt5, your original Python script, and your .app bundle are all in the same folder (Comedy/), then:
The .app may not know it needs to activate the virtual environment.
When launched, the app likely uses system Python, which doesn't have your dependencies (like PyQt5, OpenCV, or mediapipe).
GUI apps launched via .app don't show terminal errors, so it may fail silently.
‚úÖ Here's How to Fix It
Assuming you're using Automator to wrap your script into an app, here's how to ensure it activates your virtual environment before running the program:
üîß Fix: Use a Shell Script with Automator
Open Automator ‚Üí Choose Application
Select Run Shell Script
Paste the following script, adjusting paths accordingly:
bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash
# Activate your virtual environment
source "$HOME/Comedy/PyQt5/bin/activate"

# Run your Python script
python3 "$HOME/Comedy/your_script.py"
Replace your_script.py with the actual filename.
Save this as an application (e.g., ComedyApp.app) somewhere like your Desktop.
Double-click the app. It should now behave exactly like running the script in Terminal with the environment activated.
üìÅ Notes:
Make sure paths are absolute ‚Äî don‚Äôt use ~, use /Users/yourname/....
If you moved the Comedy folder or renamed anything, update the script accordingly.
üîç Bonus: Check If This Is the Issue
You can test this right now in Terminal:
bash
Copy
Edit
source ~/Comedy/PyQt5/bin/activate
python3 ~/Comedy/your_script.py
‚úÖ If it runs correctly, then the problem is definitely the app not using your virtual environment.
Would you like help generating the shell script or Automator .app for this
I shared my pwd  and path with chat:

This shows the path to my Comedy folder inside my PyQt5 repo:     judsonbelmont@MacBook-Pro ~ % cd Documents/SharedFolders/Pico/PyQt5       
judsonbelmont@MacBook-Pro PyQt5 % ls -a
.				ToDo.py
..				ToDo.ui
.DS_Store			ToDo_dBase.ui
.git				Toolbar.py
.gitignore			cleaner.py
.python-version			haar
.venv				myCleaner.py
BackUp				qt_enum_cleaner.py
Codemy				requirements.txt
HelloWorld.ui			tempCodeRunnerFile.py
Hello_2.py			todo_items.db
LearnerFolder			todo_list.db
Load_QT.md			todo_list.txt
Load_Qt2.md			treeWidget.py
PW				updated_qt_enum_cleaner.py
Tabber.py
judsonbelmont@MacBook-Pro PyQt5 %      I modified the recommended script to run in Automator as follows:  #!/bin/bash
# Activate your virtual environment
source "$HOME/PyQt5/Comedy/bin/activate"

# Run your Python script.    Does this get me to the right location for the dist/. folder to be located?

Thanks for the details ‚Äî this helps clarify the setup.
üö® Problem in Your Script:
Your virtual environment is not located at:
swift
Copy
Edit
$HOME/PyQt5/Comedy/bin/activate
Instead, from your directory listing:
Your main working directory is:
javascript
Copy
Edit
~/Documents/SharedFolders/Pico/PyQt5
Inside this, your virtual environment is called:
Copy
Edit
.venv
So, the correct path to activate your virtual environment is:
bash
Copy
Edit
source "$HOME/Documents/SharedFolders/Pico/PyQt5/.venv/bin/activate"
‚úÖ Corrected Automator Script
Here‚Äôs what your Automator ‚ÄúRun Shell Script‚Äù block should look like:
bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash

# Activate your virtual environment
source "$HOME/Documents/SharedFolders/Pico/PyQt5/.venv/bin/activate"

# Run your Python script (adjust filename if needed)
python3 "$HOME/Documents/SharedFolders/Pico/PyQt5/Codemy/ToDo.py"
Replace Codemy/ToDo.py with the actual relative path to your script if different.
üìÇ About the dist/ Folder
If you're using PyInstaller to build the app:
The dist/ folder will appear in the current working directory when you run pyinstaller.
For best results, cd into the folder where your .py script is before building with PyInstaller.
Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ~/Documents/SharedFolders/Pico/PyQt5/Codemy
pyinstaller --onefile ToDo.py
This will place ToDo (the app) inside Codemy/dist/.
Would you like a ready-to-use Automator .workflow example or a .command file you can double-click instead?
I used py2app, not pyinstaller.   and this is the path to my program in the list/...         /Users/judsonbelmont/Documents/SharedFolders/Pico/PyQt5/Codemy/dist/ToDo_icon.app/Contents/Resources/ToDo_icon.py.  Can you give me the script for the automator?

Since you're using py2app, and your built app lives at:
swift
Copy
Edit
/Users/judsonbelmont/Documents/SharedFolders/Pico/PyQt5/Codemy/dist/ToDo_icon.app
‚Ä¶but your app isn't behaving as expected ‚Äî likely because the virtual environment or other runtime dependencies (like PyQt5) aren‚Äôt being activated or bundled correctly ‚Äî then here‚Äôs how to fix that using Automator.
‚úÖ Objective
You want to:
Activate your virtual environment (.venv inside PyQt5).
Run your original .py file (not the .app) from Automator to preserve original behavior.
‚úÖ Step-by-Step: Automator Script
Open Automator.
Choose "Application".
Add a "Run Shell Script" action.
Paste the following corrected script:
bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash

# Activate your virtual environment
source "$HOME/Documents/SharedFolders/Pico/PyQt5/.venv/bin/activate"

# Run the Python file directly (not the .app)
python3 "$HOME/Documents/SharedFolders/Pico/PyQt5/Codemy/ToDo_icon.py"
Note: This bypasses the .app created by py2app and runs the original .py file directly inside the activated virtual environment, which solves your issue.
Save it as something like:
Launch_ToDo_App.workflow
or
ToDo_OriginalRunner.app (make sure it‚Äôs saved as an "Application").
üß™ Test It
Now, double-click your saved Automator app ‚Äî your PyQt5 program should launch exactly as it did before converting it into an app.
Would you like help fixing the actual .app with py2app so it includes your virtual environment libraries and runs independently of the terminal?

Automator doesn‚Äôt directly show a "Save As‚Ä¶" dialog when you enter a shell script. Here's how to save your Automator script as an app in a specific location (like your Desktop or Comedy folder):
‚úÖ Save Automator Script as a Mac App
Open Automator and ensure:
You selected ‚ÄúApplication‚Äù as the document type (important!).
After entering your script, go to the top menu:
Click File ‚Üí Save‚Ä¶
In the Save dialog:
Name it something like ToDo_OriginalRunner
Choose a folder, e.g.:
Desktop
or Comedy (~/Documents/SharedFolders/Pico/PyQt5/Comedy)
Ensure File Format is "Application"
Click Save.
‚úÖ Test the Saved App
Double-click your new .app (e.g., ToDo_OriginalRunner.app).
If all paths are correct, it should launch your PyQt5 program with virtual environment activated ‚Äî exactly as it behaved before packaging.

To create Icons

how to properly convert rubberDuckey.png to a macOS-compatible .icns file:
Step 1: Create an .iconset folder
mkdir rubberDuckey.iconset
Step 2: Generate icon sizes from your PNG
Make sure rubberDuckey.png is square (e.g., 1024√ó1024). Then run:

sips -z 16 16     rubberDuckey.png --out rubberDuckey.iconset/icon_16x16.png
sips -z 32 32     rubberDuckey.png --out rubberDuckey.iconset/icon_16x16@2x.png
sips -z 32 32     rubberDuckey.png --out rubberDuckey.iconset/icon_32x32.png
sips -z 64 64     rubberDuckey.png --out rubberDuckey.iconset/icon_32x32@2x.png
sips -z 128 128   rubberDuckey.png --out rubberDuckey.iconset/icon_128x128.png
sips -z 256 256   rubberDuckey.png --out rubberDuckey.iconset/icon_128x128@2x.png
sips -z 256 256   rubberDuckey.png --out rubberDuckey.iconset/icon_256x256.png
sips -z 512 512   rubberDuckey.png --out rubberDuckey.iconset/icon_256x256@2x.png
sips -z 512 512   rubberDuckey.png --out rubberDuckey.iconset/icon_512x512.png
sips -z 1024 1024 rubberDuckey.png --out rubberDuckey.iconset/icon_512x512@2x.png
Step 3: Convert to .icns
Now convert the rubberDuckey.iconset folder to .icns:

iconutil -c icns rubberDuckey.iconset
This creates rubberDuckey.icns in the current directory.
üîÅ What to do next
Use the resulting rubberDuckey.icns file when building your PyInstaller app:

DO NOT USE :     pyinstaller --windowed --icon=rubberDuckey.icns ToDo.py

No, it is not necessary‚Äîand actually not recommended‚Äîto run pyinstaller at all if you're using py2app.
Here's why:
pyinstaller and py2app are completely separate packaging tools.
pyinstaller is cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux), while py2app is designed specifically for macOS.
Do not mix them‚Äîyou only need to run one, and since you're creating a .app for macOS, use py2app only.
‚úÖ What you should do:
Just follow these steps:
Ensure rubberDuckey.icns and setup.py are in the same directory.
Run:

python setup.py py2app
After that, you'll get a dist/ToDo.app with the duck icon already applied‚Äîno need for pyinstaller at all.
