Step-by-Step Setup on macOS
my aliases  designer and pyuic5

to run the pyuic5 use' pyuic5 HelloWorld.ui -o HelloWorld.py" to position the output in a .py file

HelloWorld_1.py works with the basic qt_enum_cleaner.py plus added the if __name...

1. Install Qt (Includes Designer) Using Homebrew
If you don’t already have Homebrew:
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
Then install Qt (includes Qt Designer GUI): brew install qt
Once installed, locate Designer:
bash
Copy
Edit
brew list qt
You should see something like:
bash
Copy
Edit
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/qt/6.6.2/bin/designer
That’s your Qt Designer executable.
2. Run Qt Designer
Add it to your path or just run:
bash
Copy
Edit
/opt/homebrew/opt/qt/bin/designer
Or create a shortcut:
bash
Copy
Edit
alias designer="/opt/homebrew/opt/qt/bin/designer"
Now you can simply type:
bash
Copy
Edit
designer
3. Use .ui Files in Your PyQt5 Project
You can now design GUIs with drag-and-drop and save .ui files. To use those in Python:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pyqt5 pyqt5-tools
Then convert .ui to .py (if needed):
bash
Copy
Edit
pyuic5 your_file.ui -o your_file.py
✅ Summary

Task	Method
Install Designer	brew install qt
Launch Designer	/opt/homebrew/opt/qt/bin/designer
Convert .ui to .py	pyuic5 yourfile.ui -o output.py
Avoid pyqt5-tools	It’s mostly for Windows environments

fine through steps 1 and 2.  I am able to open Designer with the alias from my terminal.   I then opened the same folder in VSCode, using the virtual environment . Entering the command 'designer' in the terminal was not recognized.I also tried to install 'pip install pyqt5 pyqt5-tools' 
ssue 1: designer not found in VS Code terminal

When you're in your VS Code terminal, it likely uses a different shell environment than your main terminal (where the alias designer=... works).
✅ Fix: Add the alias to your shell startup file
If you're using zsh (likely on macOS), add this line to your ~/.zshrc:
bash

alias designer="/opt/homebrew/opt/qt/bin/designer"
Then in VS Code's terminal:
bash

source ~/.zshrc
Now designer will work inside the VS Code terminal too"
Issue 2: pip install pyqt5 pyqt5-tools fails

You're right—pyqt5-tools is still problematic on macOS. But you already have Qt Designer, so you don’t need it.
✅ Just use PyQt5
From within your virtual environment, this is all you need:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install PyQt5
No need for pyqt5-tools
Workflow Summary:

Task	            Tool
GUI Designer	    Launch with designer alias (fixed via .zshrc)
GUI Design	        Save .ui files
Convert .ui → .py	Use pyuic5 (included with PyQt5)
Run GUI in Python	Use PyQt5 package only
Example: Converting a .ui File

Let’s say you design a file mygui.ui using Qt Designer.
In your virtual environment:
bash
Copy
Edit
pyuic5 mygui.ui -o mygui.py
Now you can import and use mygui.py directly in your PyQt5 project


I switched to bash and loaded instriuctions in Bash
ice! Since you're now using bash in VSCode, you'll want to add your designer alias to your bash startup file instead of .zshrc.
✅ Steps to Make designer Work in VS Code Bash Terminal
Open your .bash_profile or .bashrc file:
bash
Copy
Edit
nano ~/.bash_profile
(If that doesn’t exist, try nano ~/.bashrc)
Add the alias to the bottom:
bash
Copy
Edit
alias designer="/opt/homebrew/opt/qt/bin/designer"
Save and exit: Press Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter.
Reload the bash profile in your VSCode terminal:
bash
Copy
Edit
source ~/.bash_profile
Test it:
bash
Copy
Edit
designer
If everything went well, Qt Designer should launch from your VSCode terminal now
